# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a full-stack developer detransitioning from gardening back to Tech.
With my mother and grandmother being software engineers, I've always felt passionate about making Tech more diverse. After getting curious about web development at the age of 14 creating my own blog with Blogspot I finally decided to dive deeper into it, so I decided to join CodeOpâ€™s Full-Stack Development Bootcamp. Here I received +550 hours of advanced training in technologies such as JavaScript ES6+, ReactJS, ReactContext API, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.
Now I am ready to hone and grow my full-stack development skills in a supportive product-centric company, working with enthusiastic people, enjoying writing clean code, and contributing to impactful products.
