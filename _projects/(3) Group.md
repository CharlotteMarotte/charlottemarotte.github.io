description: - Full-stack Web App that is creating a community of
 neighbors who feel valued and supported by
 exchanging services with each other
 - Implemented most of the application views
 (frontend), and a wallet feature (frontend and
 backend) that allows users to get “paid” (in hours
 instead of money) and feel valued for their work
 and experience reciprocal relationships
 - Collaborated with a team of four using Agile
 principles and Git/Github version control.
